            Despite their impressive features, tigers face significant threats to their survival. Habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching for their bones, skin, and other body parts have led to a decline in tiger populations. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of protected areas and anti-poaching measures, are crucial for the preservation of these magnificent creatures.

Tigers play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by controlling herbivore populations. Efforts to raise awareness, enforce stricter conservation laws, and promote sustainable coexistence with tigers are essential for ensuring the long-term survival of this iconic species.
